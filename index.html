        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We students, with the objectives of educating students on their rights in the conduct system and in the legal system, while trying to expand the rights of students in the conduct system to better resemble those in the legal system, and coming to the protection of them create this organization that shall be named the University of Dayton Student Advocates (UDSA).<br ><br >UDSA seeks to educate students about the conduct system. Sometimes it seems like students who get written up have little information about their status, and UDSA seeks to guide students along their path. We are always looking for people to join our organization so please contact us if you wish to represent students on this campus.<br ><br >UDSA is an organization of students dedicated to freedom of speech and due process. We lobby for change to the University of Dayton conduct system and support students as they move through the conduct system. Our goals include implementing and maintaining a campus that encourages freedom of expression and the marketplace of ideas, as well as a conduct system with high standards of due process.
